  <h1>Immergent Manifolds: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Immergent (immanent + emergence) Manifolds (portals for connecting the inhabitant, environmentally benign carbon processing and spacetime across scales) 
  are initially explored as a novel design methodology that helps us modulate the striated and smooth space of 
  elegant streamlined high-performing composites habitats. 
    
  A series of interdisciplinary instances unveil the relational, no-hierarchical, and dynamic process required to prepare such a risky mission, 
  a story that was temporarily modified by Balmat's and the scientific elite, as in the Mont Blanc first ascent (*add emails).

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts. 
                
                They start as a series of generic plywood and plexiglass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>,
                and evolve into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                First, different sites are experienced while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded throughout the day by using computer vision, resulting in image schematas of emerging light phenomena, 
                that is later materialized as laser cut transparent stacks and islands, forms of inhabitable shells.

              <p>Building upon the Fulcrum House (*add publication), this research project extends the exploration to dis/assamble composite habitats.

                Situated by a cliff in Upstate New York, the cantilivering habitat adapts through performative manifolds (subtracted cores and additively produced details for skin wrapping), 
                to the inhabitant's desires, the site and local anomalies of the jointing system.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
