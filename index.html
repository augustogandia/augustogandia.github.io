  <h1>Carbon Manifolds: An Architecture for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  These immanent Carbon Manifolds are initially explored and framed through the lens of Immergence, 
  an intuitive design methodology that leverages novel, 
  environmentally benign materials and therefore modulates the striated and smooth space of 
  elegant, streamlined, and carbon habitats across scales. 
    
  As in the old Tale of Mont Blanc ascent, Balmat and the scientific elite attempted to erase the initiator of the expedition,
  due to his practical, often unorthodox methods. This series of interdisciplinary instances serves to prove his participation 
  and a critical perspective for unveiling the sinuous alternative path,
  , one that is necessary to navigate the inclemencies of
  relational, no-hierarchical, and dynamic theoretical and practice-related ecosystems.

                This teaching and research project explores m(a)cro scale artifacts in light of the inhabitants' view, site, materiality, and time. 
                
                Dexter from the Media Lab proposed a series of generic plywood and plexiglass light sculptures <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a> that
                later transformed into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                Designing such situated manifolds started by experiencing different spaces while searching for interesting moments with light and their history. 
                The selected candidates are recorded through computer vision as revisitable image schemata, which are materialized as streamlined bespoke
                plexiglass stacks as an inhabitable shell.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
