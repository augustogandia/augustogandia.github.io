    <p>
    This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the prefabricated bespoke system of the Carbon House. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation of private and public spaces that emerge from the lightness of fiber-reinforced components, the movements of the machining process, and their disassembly. 
    The design relates to the site through minimally invasive subtracted perforations that hold them into the wall panel without additional frames and through channels for detail embedding (e.g. gaskets). As such, the integral design maximizes daylight, guarantees air-tightness, and allows for disassembly.

    <h2>Gradual Assemblies (MAS ETH DFAB, 2018)</h2>

    <p>This teaching and research project aims at digitally designing and fabricating an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, planned to be produced as modules at the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, and shipped and assembled at the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
       The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of an inward and outward quintet of forces, including students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood).
       Fabrication starts by robotically shaping, placing, and orienting a timber slat. A second robot performs a minimally invasive perforation, to be joined by leveraging human dexterity and the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, adjusting the humidity for interlocking through expansion, and cutting the dowels (using traditional Japanese saws). 
       This strategy allows designing for disassembly, future extension, and reuse through a material, waste, and onsite assembly-conscious approach
