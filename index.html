  <h1>Carbon Manifolds: Ecologic Habitats for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Carbon Manifolds are initially explored and framed through the lens of Immergence, 
  intuitively modulating multi-scale striated and smooth spaces through elegant, streamlined, 
  and environmentally benign carbon buildings. As in the modified tale of the first ascent to Mont Blanc, 
  the expeditionary spirit of Dr. Paccard was erased by Balmat's association with the scientific elite. 
  However, a series of dated interdisciplinary instances demonstrates the true nature of pursuing such risky endeavors, 
  an alternative path of winding architectures that may be necessary to succeed in relational, non-hierarchical, and dynamic ecosystems.

              This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the Carbon House's bespoke system. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation between private and public space, as well as architecture and product design, emerging from digitally and physically prototyped fiber-reinforced 3D-printed assembled parts and minimally processed wall-panel perforations.
              The exceptional weight-to-strength ratio of the digitally conceived composite material enables the removal of the frame and integration of sealing details directly on the window pane, guaranteeing maximum daylight, air-tightness, and easy disassembly for replacement or repair.

                This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. 
                It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, entirely digitally planned to be produced as dis/assemblable modules in the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, to be part of the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
                The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of a quintet formed by students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood, etc). 
                While a robot cuts, places, and orients a timber slat, the second machine performs a minimally invasive perforation that serves to connect the parts by manually inserting and cutting a dried dowel that is humidified for expansion and interlocking. 
                Despite the design intended to cover the terrace extension, it was partially designed for the corner of the terrace, as a demonstration. After summertime, the pavilion was disassembled and partially reused in the <a href="https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/e/lehre/375.html" target="_blank">Up-sticks</a> art exhibition.

              This investigation explores two different design methods for composite details. Firstly, a bachelor's thesis results in designs that are conceived through a prosthetic approach of material, machining, and site mediation.  
              Secondly, an interdisciplinary assembly enables the exploration of such integral designs beyond performance and optimization.

              This workshop investigates a range of digital design methods, inspired by culture and the site, to flexibly explore streamlined carbon architecture. 
              While it is marerialized as a series of <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">lighting objects</a>, it evokes the architectural nature of several previously explored carbon dwellings, 
              demonstrating its reuse potential across scales.
