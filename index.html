  <h1>Hypo-skins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Today, human-made mass already exceeds biomass and 
  Bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production. 
  The organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity for reorienting its primary use
  from burning primarily for motion to assembling shells for embracing our dynamic realities. 
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that addresses the projected doubling of residential buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hypo-skins are portals that bridge the inhabitant with carbon-based materials across space and time. 
  As in the tale of the Mont Blanc ascent, 
  this series of interdisciplinary instances aims to unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram to reconnect architecture theory and practice.

              This project is conducted as part of an independent teaching activity (IAP) at MIT,
              a site of multiplicities involving several internal and external collaborators 
              across disciplines. While the initial brief started as a techno-rationalist design exercise of wooden 
              typographies - a product of material, processing, and other technical constraints - it evolved 
              into <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>, 
              which find themselves in the setting of constraints. The quasi-allegorical form - reminiscent of a historical collaboration that turns
              into an interdisciplinary exchange with the Media Lab - fosters
              an internal and external dialogue of fluid paths (e.g., circuits, circulations, etc.) and force fields (e.g., connections, spaces, etc.), 
              simultaneously merging into mathematically offset curves modulated across connected layers 
              of translucent and opaque shades. 
              <br><br>  
              A relevant value of this sort of Asiatic sense does not reside in the gestural possibility of an animated object
              but in its potential as an architecture, the exploration of a multiplicity of precisely indeterminate habitats.  
              Formally, the object announces a new territory of implicit degradation of property: the roof becomes a wall, the structure fuses with the surface, 
              the openings emerge and merge into the temporal register of the overall design. All delineations of Modernist rationality dissolve in the seamless 
              and reciprocal processing of the inexpressive fluid family of designs, contemplating their non-standard post-industrial manufacturing nature.

                This design studio, as part of the MAS ETH DFAB, explores a different scale of 
                a family of pergolas for enjoying the Roman sun at the Swiss Institute.
                While framing views towards the Church of Sant'Isidoro, a single doubly-curved surface of gradually oriented wooden elements
                modulates the awkward corner of the terrace from the new building to the Villa Maraini.
                A selection process involving the client and several internal competing candidates 
                led to a design that adjusts to the limited budget of the seasonal art installation 
                and that leverages the flexibility of computation,
                two arms of the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory (ETH Zurich), 
                and the hygroscopic properties of wood for interlocking.
                <br><br>
                A virtual wiring interconnects the inexpressive and indeterminate hypo-surface with its parts, 
                a rehearsed choreography of students, machines, material,
                and a site, globally and locally adjusting to forgiving constraints (e.i, a comfortable shade and emerging branches for compensating overstretched areas). 
                Advised by our engineers, we prototyped the largest span of the structure,  
                a test that validated the unusual flexural capacities of our elastic model. 
                Similar specimens constitute the entire prefabricated cocoon, enabling the
                efficient shipping from Zurich to Rome and its assembly in just a few days
                for the opening Apéro.  
                <br><br>
                The design benefits from a continuity of creative and post-industrial manufacturing 
                and introduces a different degree of elasticity. This precision without auto-determinism
                results in an artifact that is more complex than we would have designed. As Prof. Goulthorpe 
                explains, such an approach exemplifies a step further in the evolution towards reciprocal auto (auto-dictated fixed environment)
                and alloplastic (indeterminate environment) transformations, both in the
                creative process and the architecture itself.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts.

                The design process starts by experiencing different sites while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded through computer vision as image schemata of emerging light phenomena, 
                later materialized as inhabitable bays or islands of transparent stacked intensities.

                This project builds upon a workshop titled Topographies of Light, 
                conducted at MIT in collaboration with Aileen Iverson () and Andy Payne (McNeel). 
                While we first explored differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise consisted of setting constraints 
                by which the form could find itself. As such, we designed a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells through the internal forces of the material and other 
                essential elements, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                Each participant assembled a portal for linking a sensing skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                enabling a "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
