  <h1>Beyond the Poles - A quiet and persistent architecture of carbon-conscious materials, digital tools, and human practice to co-generate novel forms of dwelling.</h1>
  <p>
    
    In 1786, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQ9QKSLOJAP7dlO_QWUaKgfAwgfz8u8lUvcEeCJEyD0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dr. Michel-Gabriel Paccard</a> quietly prepared for the first ascent of Mont Blanc. Guided by scientific curiosity rather than spectacle, he navigated an uncertain path, collaborating with unfamiliar systems and enduring harsh conditions. 
    His success was later overshadowed by Jacques Balmat, whose alliance with the scientific elite rewrote the story. Paccard’s patient, detail-driven approach — rigorous yet often invisible — offers a potent metaphor for digital design that resists the lure of speed, market visibility, and closed disciplinary loops. It reminds us that meaningful innovation often happens outside the spotlight, through persistent negotiation between disciplines, tools, and environments.
    Ecological Material Computation follows this Paccard-like path. It is a design philosophy in which carbon-conscious composites and distributed fabrication are not mere optimizations, but catalysts for rethinking the grammar of dwelling. Bidirectional simulations of material behavior, tool choreography, and human practice produce form as a lived event — fostering care, repair, and community. This is not a market spectacle or a temporary “transition,” 
    but an ontological project that resists the self-referential “bachelor machine” of purely internal logic, engaging instead with ecological, social, and cultural forces to reshape how people relate to matter, place, and one another.

              This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, planned to be produced as modules at the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, and shipped and assembled at the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
              The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of the quintet's inward and outward forces: students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood).
              Fabrication starts by robotically shaping, placing, and orienting a timber slat. A second robot performs a minimally invasive perforation, to be joined by leveraging human dexterity and the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, adjusting the humidity for interlocking through expansion, and cutting the dowels (using traditional Japanese saws). 
              This strategy allows designing for disassembly, future extension, and reuse through a material, waste, and onsite assembly-conscious approach
