  <h1>Hyposkins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Today, human-made mass already exceeds biomass and 
  Bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production. 
  The organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity for reorienting its primary use
  from fuel burned for motion to dynamic shells that map our realities. 
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that addresses the projected doubling of residential buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hyposkins are the connections between inhabitants and carbon across spacetime. 
  These interdisciplinary instances unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

              This project is conducted as part of an independent teaching activity (IAP) at MIT,
              a site of multiplicities involving several internal and external collaborators 
              across disciplines. While the initial brief started as a techno-rationalist design exercise of wooden 
              typographies - a product of material, processing, and other technical constraints - MIT's protocol 
              (including the involvement of Prof. Kilian and other potential scanning-devices) positively influenced it
              towards <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>, 
              which find themselves in the setting of constraints. The quasi-allegorical form - reminiscent of a historical collaboration that turns
              into an interdisciplinary exchange with the Media Lab - fosters
              an internal and external dialogue of fluid paths (e.g., circuits, circulations, etc.) and force fields (e.g., connections, spaces, etc.), 
              simultaneously merging into mathematically offset curves modulated across connected layers 
              of translucent and opaque shades. 
              <br><br>  
              A relevant value of this sort of Asiatic sense does not reside in the gestural possibility of an animated object
              but in its potential as an architecture, the exploration of a multiplicity of precisely indeterminate habitats.  
              Formally, the object announces a new territory of implicit degradation of property: the roof becomes a wall, the structure fuses with the surface, 
              the openings emerge and merge into the temporal register of the overall design. All delineations of Modernist rationality dissolve in the seamless 
              and reciprocal processing of the inexpressive fluid family of designs, contemplating their non-standard post-industrial manufacturing nature.

                This design studio, as part of the MAS ETH DFAB, explores a different scale of 
                a family of pergolas that enables us to enjoy the Roman sun at the Swiss Institute.
                While framing views towards the Church of Sant'Isidoro, a single doubly-curved surface of gradually oriented wooden elements
                modulates the passage through the awkward corner of a terrace towards the Villa Maraini.
                A selection process involving the client and an internal design competition 
                led to a design that balances the limited budget of the seasonal art installation 
                and the reduced three months of the project.
                <br><br>
                A virtual wiring interconnects the inexpressive and indeterminate hypo-surface with the parts mentioned above, 
                a rehearsed choreography of students, machines (two gantry robots of the RFL), the hygroscopic properties of wood,
                and a site, globally and locally adjusting to forgiving constraints (e.i, a comfortable shade and emerging branches for compensating overstretched areas). 
                Advised by our engineers, we prototyped the largest span of the structure,  
                a test that validated the unusual flexural capacities of our elastic model. 
                Similar specimens constitute the entire prefabricated cocoon, enabling the
                efficient shipping from Zurich to Rome and its assembly in just a few days,
                right on time for the opening Apéro.  
                <br><br>
                The design benefits from a continuity of creative and post-industrial manufacturing 
                and introduces a different degree of elasticity. This precision without auto-determinism
                results in an artifact that is more complex than we would have designed. As Prof. Goulthorpe 
                explains, such an approach exemplifies a step further in the evolution towards reciprocal auto (auto-dictated fixed environment)
                and alloplastic (indeterminate environment) transformations, both in the
                creative process and the architecture itself.

              <p>
              In collaboration with several stakeholders and the Department of Energy (DOE), 
              The Fulcrum is not about elastic explorations, but a new capture of energetics into a prefabricated modular
              frozen calculus. Human vitality, the toolpaths to attain sophisticated product design, as well as transportation, and ease of assembly 
              are the main generative forces of these inhabitable "single-family" Gourdoukis' forks of 
              environmentally benign material (i.e., carbon nanotubes and foams). 
              This sort of compartmentalized flexibility also allows for integration of
              framed views, solar paths, and ventilation, as well as in-house heating and cooling sources
              in a cantilevering play of volumes.
              <br><br>  
              The main focus is the potential of calculus-imagining, and its implicit gener(a)ctive potential explored
              through a skin that adapts to the American landscape. While unremarkable thickness variations 
              and orientations constitute strategic performance-oriented changes, the details adjust to internal
              considerations. This is visible at the ends of the envelope, a derived form incrementally adjusting 
              to attain desirable gradients of daylight glare. These mathematically generated surfaces and forms are 
              compatible with formats for direct manufacturing through CNC machining.   
              <br><br>
              External decor(a)ctive aspects of the envelope were explored in collaboration with Prof. Mark Burry, 
              particularly the staircase's environmental, social, and aesthetic arabesque expressions mapped at the envelope. 
              A weighted paramorph allows the negotiation of aperture between reinforcement placement and attractor logics of internal (e.g., views and privacy) 
              and external asymmetries (e.g., daylight). As such, frozen responsiveness gets integrated in a 3D printed facade, 
              a new possibility of fabricated expressivity through recyclable, hopefully lightweight
              additive traces.
              <br><br>
              The modular nature of the project unlocks a respectful conversation between 
              the Southern extroverted groundfloor space and the Northern, more private cantilevering volume. 
              Surrounded by open spaces for connecting with the exterior, this configuration constitutes a unique bonding opportunity
              present in the covalent possibilities of carbon. In relation to previously introduced urbanistic schemas,
              the molecule opens up the chance to bond to enhance both unity and secular-related living qualities.

              The movement trapped in the Gradual Assemblies, and the Fulcrum 
              may be released according to stimuli in this single-family house, 
              a project emerging from the mutual interest of the Carbon<>Building initiative and ARPA-E. 
              Generous and simultaneously affordable, the proposal exceeds the realm of reactive shells
              through sentient skins that blur the boundaries between inhabitant and site in residential projects. 
              A cliff in the desert of Las Vegas allows us to 
              explore foregrounds' operative design strategies
              one step further into alloplastic novel territories. 
                
              The project hints towards a novel urbanistic link with the Gradual assemblies, the molecular benefits of modular 'forks' (Fulcrum)
              are complemented with extroverted 'papercups' of increased incremental flexibility.  
              This is embodied in its relatively simple form, a repairable, faceted network of layered intelligent matter,
              that reflect the events of daily life. 
              Such a synaesthetic potential is explored through the wiring of background and foreground, 
              senses that become accessible through interdisciplinary iterative work and 
              through vanishing tunable perspectives.

              The surface will be able to register waves of matter and timely launch, provoking effects and affects
              on the lived experience, beyond comfort and health. This is achieved through the strategic
              arrangement of material within each panel, enabling the storage, addition, or removal of heat according to stimuli, 
              deployed by both active and passive sensors. This can be linked to the base
              electrical service or operate independently, and coordinated by a decentralized bus system linked to an operational matrix.  
              This nervous system embeds receptors of movement, humidity, and temperature, as well as (super)capacity to dampen
              imbalances and initial kickoff for active systems.  
              
              Throughout the investigation, writing in the general sense becomes primary, in the theoretical and concrete mathematics required to 
              transition from unpredictable to emerging systems. The human is an essential part of these processes, 
              an iterative loop eventually synthesized in a more or less stable play. Information becomes mathematics 
              to foreground the underlying shared language of cognitive complementary artifacts, beyond CAD environments. 
              In relation to this, working with more experienced architects and across disciplines has been challenging but liberating,
              an essential part of the process. 

              The project ventures into the cultural, technical, and psychological potential of 
              shifting from mechanical design approaches towards electronic environments of creativity. 
              This builds upon the concepts of 'Stoss' coined by Heidegger and Walter Benjamin, and of 'trauma' by Goulthorpe,  
              challenging the reactive nature of shock through a computationally enabled
              "motivated suspension" that samples individual and social experience through embodied senses.
              As such, we transition from a reciprocally negotiated transformation of skin and inhabitant to include the site as well.
              A new residential paradigm is explored, extending previous research to its cultural reception.

                This sequel to Topographies of Light was designed for 
                ACADIA: Habits of the Anthropocene; a negotiation between the details and organs of the Stealth House.
                We delve into Goulthorpe's and Vattimo's counter(act) to Virilio's perspective on
                ubiquitous networks of scanning devices and their oppressive, panoptic surveillance state that can be enforced on our behaviour. 
                In collaboration with Aileen, we explore the multiplicity of a self-constructed physical interface with embedded microsensors 
                connected to our digital design environment, a site of play, disorientation, and opportunity rather than total control.
                
                as an exploration of this "soft, fluid" reality where the user (the body) interacts playfully with the network of data, subverting the idea of a singular, controlling gaze.
                
                2. Engaging with Han's Critique of Busyness and Superficiality
                The Problem of Superficiality: Han argues that the constant "present-at-hand" data flows lead to superficial experience. By immersing the body in these flows, your method can aim to move beyond superficial scanning.
                The Value of the Body: The "body interaction" aspect of your method is crucial. Han is implicitly an embodied philosopher; the sensation of time, the "scent" of time, is a physical, sensual experience. Your method can argue that by using the body to navigate and interact with the data environment, you are not just consuming data, but generating a meaningful, embodied experience that resists the abstract, disembodied nature of mere data consumption.
                Reclaiming Contemplation through Interaction: You can argue that traditional contemplation (sitting still, thinking) is no longer the only way to achieve depth in a digital age. Your hybrid method creates a new space for "active contemplation"—a focused, embodied engagement that allows the user to linger within the data, explore new spatial/temporal relationships, and find depth within the flux, rather than being swept away by its busyness.
                
                
                While we first explored differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise consisted of setting constraints 
                by which the form could find itself. As such, we designed a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells through the internal forces of the material and other 
                essential elements, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                Each participant assembled a portal for linking a sensing skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                enabling a "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
