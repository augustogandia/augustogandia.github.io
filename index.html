    <h2>Frameless Pivots (Carbon House, 2023)</h2>
    <p>
    This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the prefabricated bespoke system of the Carbon House. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation of private and public spaces that emerge from the lightness of fiber-reinforced components, the movements of the machining process, and their disassembly. 
    The design relates to the site through minimally invasive subtracted perforations that hold them into the wall panel without additional frames and through channels for gasket embedding. As such, the integral design maximizes daylight, guarantees air-tightness, and allows for disassembly.

    <h2>Gradual Assemblies (MAS ETH DFAB, 2018)</h2>
    <p>This teaching and research project is a student competition for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It consists of an ephemeral shading canopy planned to be produced at the multi-Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich and assembled in modules at the top of one of a set of stratified architectures. The pergola emerges through the interaction of a quintet of inwards and outwards forces, including students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood). 
       This choreography starts by robotically shaping and placing timber slats while a material use and waste planned perforation is performed to be joined by leveraging the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, cutting (using traditional Japanese saws), and adjusting the dowels’ humidity to expand and interlock (no glue or screws needed). The all-timber structure is digitally conceived and produced for on-site assembly and disassembly, allowing for exploration of image schemata, potentially disassemblable designs, and their expansions.
