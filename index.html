  <h1>Hypo-skins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Today, human-made mass already exceeds biomass and 
  Bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production. 
  The organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity for reorienting its primary use
  from burning primarily for motion to assembling shells for embracing our dynamic realities. 
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that addresses the projected doubling of buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hypo-skins are portals to bridge the inhabitant, the site, and high-performance carbon materials across space and time. 
  As in the tale of the Mont Blanc ascent (to be updated), 
  this series of interdisciplinary instances aims to unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram (tbu) that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

              This open-ended site, conducted as an MIT independent teaching activity (IAP), auto- and alloplastically adapts to input from external collaborators and participants.
              The proposal starts as a techno-rationalist design exercise of wooden <a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/topographies_of_light_a_design_exploration_of_digitally_fabricated_distributed_lighting_systems" target="_blank">typographies</a> 
              that responded to material, processing, and other technical constraints.
              A visit to Prof. Kilian and subsequent involvement of Aileen shifted the brief towards exploring fields of light within 'designed' spaces.

                This project builds upon a workshop titled Topographies of Light, 
                conducted at MIT in collaboration with Aileen Iverson () and Andy Payne (McNeel). 
                While we first explored differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise consisted of setting constraints 
                by which the form could find itself. As such, we designed a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells through the internal forces of the material and other 
                essential elements, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                Each participant assembled a portal for linking a sensing skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                enabling a "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
