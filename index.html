  <h1>Hypo-skins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Where human-made mass already exceeds biomass, 
  bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production, 
  and the organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity that needs reorientation from its primary use as fuel.
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that responds 
  to the projected doubling of buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hypo-skins are portals that bridge the inhabitant, the site, and high-performance carbon materials across space and time. 
  As in the Mont Blanc ascent, this series of interdisciplinary instances unveils my contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

                This collaborative teaching project explores a series of elastic shells through internal forces that
                are not gesturally determined but respond to asiatic sensed fields of vectors (...). These complex hydrophobic constructs
                fusse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces that can be inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts. 
                
                They start as a series of generic plywood and plexiglass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>,
                and evolve into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                The design process starts by experiencing different sites while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded through computer vision as image schemata of emerging light phenomena, 
                later materialized as inhabitable bays or islands of transparent stacked intensities.
