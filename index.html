  <h1>Hypo-skins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Today, human-made mass already exceeds biomass and 
  Bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production. 
  The organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity for reorienting its primary use
  from burning primarily for motion to assembling shells for embracing our dynamic realities. 
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that addresses the projected doubling of residential buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hypo-skins are portals that bridge the inhabitant with carbon-based materials across space and time. 
  As in the tale of the Mont Blanc ascent, 
  this series of interdisciplinary instances aims to unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram to reconnect architecture theory and practice.

              This project is conducted as part of an independent teaching activity (IAP) at MIT, a site of multiplicities involving several
              internal and external collaborators across disciplines. While the initial brief started as a techno-rationalist design exercise of wooden typographies  
              - a product of material, processing, and other technical constraints - it evolved into <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a> 
              that find themselves in the setting of constraints. The quasi-allegorical form - reminiscent of a historical collaboration - fosters
              an internal and external dialogue of fluid paths (e.g., circuits, circulations, etc.) and force fields (e.g., connections, spaces, etc.), 
              simultaneously merging into mathematically offset curves modulated across connected layers 
              of translucent and opaque shades. 
                
              A relevant value of this sort of Asiatic sense does not reside in the gestural possibility of an animated object
              but in its potential as an architecture, the exploration of a multiplicity of precisely indeterminate habitats.  
              Formally, the object announces a new territory of implicit degradation of property: the roof becomes a wall, the structure fuses with the surface, 
              the openings emerge and merge into the temporal register of the overall design. All delineations of Modernist rationality dissolve in the seamless 
              and reciprocal processing of the inexpressive fluid family of designs, contemplating their non-standard post-industrial manufacturing nature.

                This design studio, as part of the MAS ETH DFAB, explores an instance 
                of a family of pergolas for enjoying the Roman sun at the Swiss Institute.
                While framing views towards the Church of Sant'Isidoro, a single doubly-curved surface of gradually oriented wooden elements
                modulates the awkward corner of the terrace connecting the new building and the Villa Maraini.
                A selected candidate results from an internal competion that adjusts to the budget of a seasonal art installation
                and leverages the hygroscopic properties of wood, dispensing with glue or unnecessary mechanical connectors beyond the non-attached footings.
                A small section is built to validate its 

                A virtual wiring interconnects the surface and its parts, a rehearsed choreography of students, machines, material,
                and site, inexpresively and indeterminately adjusting to forgiving constraints, such as
                a comfortable shade and emerging branches for compensating overstretched areas.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts.

                The design process starts by experiencing different sites while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded through computer vision as image schemata of emerging light phenomena,

                This project builds upon a workshop titled Topographies of Light, 
                conducted at MIT in collaboration with Aileen Iverson () and Andy Payne (McNeel). 
                While we first explored differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise consisted of setting constraints 
                by which the form could find itself. As such, we designed a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells through the internal forces of the material and other 
                essential elements, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                Each participant assembled a portal for linking a sensing skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                enabling a "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
