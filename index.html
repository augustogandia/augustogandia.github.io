  <h1>Immergent Manifolds: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>

  Where human-made mass already exceeds biomass, 
  bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production, 
  and the organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity that needs reorientation from its primary use as fuel.
  As part of the Carbon>Building, this investigation proposes a carbon-based ontology that responds 
  to the projected doubling of buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Immergent Manifolds are portals between the inhabitant, the site, and high-performing carbon materials across space and time. 
  As in the Mont Blanc ascent, this series of interdisciplinary instances unveils my contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

              <p>Building upon the Fulcrum House (*add publication), this research project extends the exploration to dis/assamble composite habitats.

                Situated by a cliff in Upstate New York, the cantilevering habitat adapts through performative manifolds (subtracted cores and additively produced details for skin wrapping), 
                to the inhabitant's desires, the site, and local anomalies of the jointing system.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts. 
                
                They start as a series of generic plywood and plexiglass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>,
                and evolve into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                The design process starts by experiencing different sites while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded through computer vision as image schemata of emerging light phenomena, 
                later materialized as inhabitable bays or islands of transparent stacked intensities.
