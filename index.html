  <h1>Carbon Manifolds: An Architecture for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  These immanent Carbon Manifolds are initially explored and framed through the lens of Immergence, 
  an intuitive design methodology that leverages novel, 
  environmentally benign materials and therefore modulates the striated and smooth space of 
  elegant, streamlined, and carbon habitats across scales. 
    
  As in the old Tale of Mont Blanc ascent, Balmat and the scientific elite attempted to erase the initiator of the expedition,
  due to his practical, often unorthodox methods. This series of interdisciplinary instances serves to validate his participation 
  and a critical role in unveiling an alternative path,
  one that, despite being sinuous, is necessary to map the cloud of potentialities
  in contemporary relational, no-hierarchical, and dynamic ecosystems.

                This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. 
                It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, entirely digitally planned to be produced as dis/assemblable modules in the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, to be part of the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
                The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of a quintet formed by students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood, etc). 
                While a robot cuts, places, and orients a timber slat, the second machine performs a minimally invasive perforation that serves to connect the parts by manually inserting and cutting a dried dowel that is humidified for expansion and interlocking. 
                Despite the design intended to cover the terrace extension, it was partially designed for the corner of the terrace, as a demonstration. After summertime, the pavilion was disassembled and partially reused in the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">Cloud Light</a> art exhibition 
                and <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
