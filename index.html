  <h1>Immergent Manifolds: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Immergent (immanent + emergence) Manifolds (portals for connecting the inhabitant, the site, and high-performing environmentally-benign carbon materials across space and time) 
  are a novel design methodology for exploring elegant streamlined high-performing composite habitats. 
    
  As in the Mont Blanc first ascent (*add emails), a series of interdisciplinary instances unveil the story modified by Balmat's and the scientific elite to erase the initiator.
  Beyond performance, it proposes an alternative non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic path for achieving such a endeavors.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts. 
                
                They start as a series of generic plywood and plexiglass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>,
                and evolve into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                First, different sites are experienced while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded throughout the day by using computer vision, resulting in image schematas of emerging light phenomena, 
                that is later materialized as laser cut transparent stacks and islands, forms of inhabitable shells.

              <p>Building upon the Fulcrum House (*add publication), this research project extends the exploration to dis/assamble composite habitats.

                Situated by a cliff in Upstate New York, the cantilivering habitat adapts through performative manifolds (subtracted cores and additively produced details for skin wrapping), 
                to the inhabitant's desires, the site and local anomalies of the jointing system.

              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
