  <h1>Beyond the Poles - The Erased Ascent</h1>
  <p>
    
    In 1786, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQ9QKSLOJAP7dlO_QWUaKgfAwgfz8u8lUvcEeCJEyD0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dr. Michel-Gabriel Paccard</a> quietly prepared for the first ascent of Mont Blanc. Guided by scientific curiosity rather than spectacle, he navigated an uncertain path, collaborating with unfamiliar systems and enduring harsh conditions. 
    His success was later overshadowed by Jacques Balmat, whose alliance with the scientific elite rewrote the story. Paccard’s patient, detail-driven approach — rigorous yet often invisible — offers a potent metaphor for digital design that resists the lure of speed, market visibility, and closed disciplinary loops. It reminds us that meaningful innovation often happens outside the spotlight, through persistent negotiation between disciplines, tools, and environments.
    It is a design philosophy based on Bachelard's poetics of space and Goulthorpe's body of work, in which carbon environmentally benign composite-based (e.g., CNTs and CFoams) designs, and distributed fabrication are not mere optimizations, but catalysts for the emergence of material, machining, site, and human opportunities.

              This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the prefabricated bespoke system of the Carbon House. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation of private and public spaces that emerge from the lightness of fiber-reinforced components, the movements of the machining process, and their disassembly. 
              The design relates to the site through minimally invasive subtracted perforations that hold them into the wall panel without additional frames and through channels for detail embedding (e.g. gaskets). As such, the integral design maximizes daylight, guarantees air-tightness, and allows for disassembly.

                This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, planned to be produced as modules at the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, and shipped and assembled at the stratified rooftop of the Institute. The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of the quintet's inward and outward forces: students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood). Fabrication starts by robotically shaping, placing, and orienting a timber slat. A second robot performs a minimally invasive perforation, to be joined by leveraging human dexterity and the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, adjusting the humidity for interlocking through expansion, and cutting the dowels (using traditional Japanese saws). This strategy allows designing for disassembly, future extension, and reuse through a material, waste, and onsite assembly-conscious approach.

              This investigation explores two different design methods for composite details. Firstly, a bachelor's thesis results in designs that are conceived through a prosthetic approach of material, machining, and site mediation.  
              Secondly, an interdisciplinary assembly enables the exploration of such integral designs beyond performance and optimization.

              This workshop explores the main digital design method for streamlined architecture that spans from carbon details, through houses, and the scale of dwellings. 
              It led to a series of <a href="https://dextercallender.com/" target="_blank">lamps</a> explored and digitally produced through the reuse of code, which demonstrate the approach's architectural and environmental potential.
