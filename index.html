    <p>
    This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the prefabricated bespoke system of the Carbon House. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation of private and public spaces that emerge from the lightness of fiber-reinforced components, the movements of the machining process, and their disassembly. 
    The design relates to the site through minimally invasive subtracted perforations that hold them into the wall panel without additional frames and through channels for gasket embedding. As such, the integral design maximizes daylight, guarantees air-tightness, and allows for disassembly.

    <p>This teaching and research project aims at digitally designing and fabricating an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, which is planned to be produced as modules at the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, shipped, and assembled on a rooftop surrounded by stratified architectures. 
       The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of a quintet of inward and outward forces, including students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood).
       Its fabrication starts by robotically shaping, placing and orienting a timber slat, then a minimally invasive perforation is performed by a second robot, to be joined by leveraging human dexterity and the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, adjusting the dowels’ humidity to expand (no glue or screws needed), and finally, custom cutting it (using traditional Japanese saws). 
       This strategy allows designing for disassembly, future expansion, and reuse through a material, waste, and onsite assembly conscious approach
