  <h1>Carbon Manifolds: Ecologic Habitats for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Carbon Manifolds are initially explored and framed through the lens of Immergence, 
  intuitively modulating multi-scale striated and smooth spaces through elegant, streamlined, 
  and environmentally benign carbon buildings. As in the modified tale of the first ascent to Mont Blanc, 
  the expeditionary spirit of Dr. Paccard was erased by Balmat's association with the scientific elite. 
  However, a series of dated interdisciplinary instances demonstrates the true nature of pursuing such risky endeavors, 
  an alternative path of winding architectures that may be necessary to succeed in relational, non-hierarchical, and dynamic ecosystems.

                This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. 
                It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, entirely digitally planned to be produced as dis/assemblable modules in the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, to be part of the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
                The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of a quintet formed by students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood, etc). 
                While a robot cuts, places, and orients a timber slat, the second machine performs a minimally invasive perforation that serves to connect the parts by manually inserting and cutting a dried dowel that is humidified for expansion and interlocking. 
                Despite the design intended to cover the terrace extension, it was partially designed for the corner of the terrace, as a demonstration. After summertime, the pavilion was disassembled and partially reused in the <a href="https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/e/lehre/375.html" target="_blank">Up-sticks</a> art exhibition.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
