  <h1>Beyond the <a href="https://architecture.mit.edu/sites/default/files/course-documents/22sp-4.154-syll-goulthorpe.pdf" target="_blank">Pole</a> - The Erased Ascent</h1>
  <p>
    In 1786, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQ9QKSLOJAP7dlO_QWUaKgfAwgfz8u8lUvcEeCJEyD0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dr. Michel-Gabriel Paccard</a> quietly prepared for the first ascent of Mont Blanc. 
    He was a man whose vision, preparation, and quiet persistence brought him to the summit of Mont Blanc, only to have his achievement obscured by the opportunism, neglect, and anti-system beliefs of others. Paccard was neither a diplomat, a politician, nor a lawyer; he was an intuitive introvert in 18th-century Chamonix, deeply motivated by the scientific promise of high-altitude exploration. 
    He pursued the peak driven by curiosity, creativity, humility, fairness, and desire for knowledge, proposing an alternative path to the most explored directions. His companion, Jacques Balmat, brought instruments and barometers to measure air pressure, which undoubtedly supported the endeavor. However, in the months that followed the ascent, Balmat’s narrative overtook Paccard’s by aligning with the scientific elite; he crafted a version in which he was “the architect” of the mission, while Paccard, the originator of the expedition, was diminished by narrative control, and who knows what. My work, conducted as part of the Bauhaus Uni Weimar, ETH Zurich, MIT, and as an independent researcher, concentrates on a relational, non-hierarchical, and dynamic diagram titled “Ecological Material Computation”. It is based on a novel design philosophy in which high-performing carbon-conscious composites and distributed fabrication do not simply reduce embodied energy, but alter the very grammar of dwelling. Through bidirectional simulations of material behavior, tool choreography, and human practice, form emerges as a lived event — a domestic topology that invites care, repair, and community. It is not a market spectacle or a stopgap “transition”; it is an ontological project: to reshape how people relate to matter, place, and one another.
    This publication shows a transition architecture 
    Beyond optimization and performance, it recognizes our relative perspective as designers and inhabitants while collapsing space-time, mass, and energy. 
    As such, the website reorganizes my work (X) into a research narrative that transitions from the cinematic explorations of my PhD work (handrail - Fulcrum House (Contribution: co-design/planning, and CNT's and CFOAM TGA, TEA, and LCA) and the Gradual Assemblies)
                                                                                         towards a series of concealed (monkey paw connections and structural brackets) (Contribution: co-design/planning), 
                                                                                         the Stealth House (Contribution: co-design/planning), and the lighting dwelling (co-design/planning)(X≥0).
    
    This is measured by Goulthorpe's digital interpretation of the poetics of space, beyond the pole (Ω).

              This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the Carbon House's bespoke system. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation between private and public space, as well as architecture and product design, emerging from digitally and physically prototyped fiber-reinforced 3D-printed assembled parts and minimally processed wall-panel perforations.
              The exceptional weight-to-strength ratio of the digitally conceived composite material enables the removal of the frame and integration of sealing details directly on the window pane, guaranteeing maximum daylight, air-tightness, and easy disassembly for replacement or repair.

                This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. 
                It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, entirely digitally planned to be produced as dis/assemblable modules in the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, to be part of the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
                The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of a quintet formed by students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood, etc). 
                While a robot cuts, places, and orients a timber slat, the second machine performs a minimally invasive perforation that serves to connect the parts by manually inserting and cutting a dried dowel that is humidified for expansion and interlocking. 
                Despite the design intended to cover the terrace extension, it was partially designed for the corner of the terrace, as a demonstration. After summertime, the pavilion was disassembled and partially reused in the <a href="https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/e/lehre/375.html" target="_blank">Up-sticks</a> art exhibition.

              This investigation explores two different design methods for composite details. Firstly, a bachelor's thesis results in designs that are conceived through a prosthetic approach of material, machining, and site mediation.  
              Secondly, an interdisciplinary assembly enables the exploration of such integral designs beyond performance and optimization.

              This workshop investigates a range of digital design methods, inspired by culture and the site, to flexibly explore streamlined carbon architecture. 
              While it is marerialized as a series of <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">lighting objects</a>, it evokes the architectural nature of several previously explored carbon dwellings, 
              demonstrating its reuse potential across scales.
