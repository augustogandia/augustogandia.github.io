  <h1>Hypo-skins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Where human-made mass already exceeds biomass, 
  bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production, 
  and the organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity that needs reorientation from its primary use as fuel.
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that responds 
  to the projected doubling of buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hypo-skins are portals that bridge the inhabitant, the site, and high-performance carbon materials across space and time. 
  As in the tale of the Mont Blanc ascent, this series of interdisciplinary instances aims to unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

                This project builds upon an MIT independent activity period (IAP) workshop titled Topographies of Light, 
                conducted in collaboration with Aileen Iverson () and Andy Payne (McNeel). While the initial attempt
                aimed to explore differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise encouraged
                the set of constraints by which the form could find itself. It consisted of designing a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells that not only respond to the possibilities of the material but also to other 
                essential forces, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                This was pursued through a portal linking a sensed skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                resulting in a hybrid "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                
                
                
                
                These complex hydrophilic capsules
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
