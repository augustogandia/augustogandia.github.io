  <h1>Hyposkins: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  Today, human-made mass already exceeds biomass and 
  Bizzantine assemblies consume some 40% of total energy production. 
  The organic legacy emerges as a unique opportunity for reorienting its primary use
  from fuel burned for motion to dynamic shells that map our realities. 
  This investigation proposes a carbon ontology that addresses the projected doubling of residential buildings globally by 2050. 
  <br><br>
  Hyposkins are the connections between inhabitants and carbon across spacetime. 
  These interdisciplinary instances unveil an overlooked contribution,
  a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that reconnects architecture theory and practice.

              This project is conducted as part of an independent teaching activity (IAP) at MIT,
              a site of multiplicities involving several internal and external collaborators 
              across disciplines. While the initial brief started as a techno-rationalist design exercise of wooden 
              typographies - a product of material, processing, and other technical constraints - it evolved 
              into <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cloud-light/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>, 
              which find themselves in the setting of constraints. The quasi-allegorical form - reminiscent of a historical collaboration that turns
              into an interdisciplinary exchange with the Media Lab - fosters
              an internal and external dialogue of fluid paths (e.g., circuits, circulations, etc.) and force fields (e.g., connections, spaces, etc.), 
              simultaneously merging into mathematically offset curves modulated across connected layers 
              of translucent and opaque shades. 
              <br><br>  
              A relevant value of this sort of Asiatic sense does not reside in the gestural possibility of an animated object
              but in its potential as an architecture, the exploration of a multiplicity of precisely indeterminate habitats.  
              Formally, the object announces a new territory of implicit degradation of property: the roof becomes a wall, the structure fuses with the surface, 
              the openings emerge and merge into the temporal register of the overall design. All delineations of Modernist rationality dissolve in the seamless 
              and reciprocal processing of the inexpressive fluid family of designs, contemplating their non-standard post-industrial manufacturing nature.

                This design studio, as part of the MAS ETH DFAB, explores a different scale of 
                a family of pergolas for enjoying the Roman sun at the Swiss Institute.
                While framing views towards the Church of Sant'Isidoro, a single doubly-curved surface of gradually oriented wooden elements
                modulates the awkward corner of the terrace from the new building to the Villa Maraini.
                A selection process involving the client and several internal competing candidates 
                led to a design that adjusts to the limited budget of the seasonal art installation 
                and that leverages the flexibility of computation,
                two arms of the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory (ETH Zurich), 
                and the hygroscopic properties of wood for interlocking.
                <br><br>
                A virtual wiring interconnects the inexpressive and indeterminate hypo-surface with its parts, 
                a rehearsed choreography of students, machines, material,
                and a site, globally and locally adjusting to forgiving constraints (e.i, a comfortable shade and emerging branches for compensating overstretched areas). 
                Advised by our engineers, we prototyped the largest span of the structure,  
                a test that validated the unusual flexural capacities of our elastic model. 
                Similar specimens constitute the entire prefabricated cocoon, enabling the
                efficient shipping from Zurich to Rome and its assembly in just a few days
                for the opening Apéro.  
                <br><br>
                The design benefits from a continuity of creative and post-industrial manufacturing 
                and introduces a different degree of elasticity. This precision without auto-determinism
                results in an artifact that is more complex than we would have designed. As Prof. Goulthorpe 
                explains, such an approach exemplifies a step further in the evolution towards reciprocal auto (auto-dictated fixed environment)
                and alloplastic (indeterminate environment) transformations, both in the
                creative process and the architecture itself.

              <p>
              In collaboration with several stakeholders and the Department of Energy (DOE), 
              The Fulcrum is not about elastic explorations, but a new capture of energetics into a prefabricated modular
              frozen calculus. Human vitality, the toolpaths to attain sophisticated product design, as well as transportation, and ease of assembly 
              are the main generative forces of these inhabitable "single-family" Gourdoukis' forks of 
              environmentally benign material (i.e., carbon nanotubes and foams). 
              This sort of compartmentalized flexibility also allows for integration of
              framed views, solar paths, and ventilation, as well as in-house heating and cooling sources
              into a cantilevering play of volumes.
              <br><br>  
              The main focus is the potential of calculus-imagining, and its implicit gener(a)ctive potential explored
              through a skin that adapts to the American landscape. While unremarkable thickness variations 
              and orientations constitute strategic performance-oriented changes, the details adjust to internal
              considerations. This is visible at the ends of the envelope, a derived form incrementally adjusting 
              to attain desirable gradients of daylight glare. These mathematically generated surfaces and forms are 
              compatible with formats for direct manufacturing through CNC machining.   
              <br><br>
              External decor(a)ctive aspects of the envelope were explored in collaboration with Prof. Mark Burry, 
              particularly the staircase's environmental, social, and aesthetic arabesque expressions mapped at the envelope. 
              A weighted paramorph allows the negotiation of aperture between reinforcement placement and attractor logics of internal (e.g., views and privacy) 
              and external asymmetries (e.g., daylight). As such, frozen responsiveness gets integrated in a 3D printed facade, 
              a new possibility of fabricated expressivity through recyclable, hopefully lightweight
              additive traces.
              <br><br>
              The modular nature of the project unlocks a respectful conversation between 
              the Southern extroverted groundfloor space and the Northern, more private cantilevering volume. 
              Surrounded by open spaces for connecting with the exterior, this configuration constitutes a unique bonding opportunity
              present in the covalent possibilities of carbon. In relation to previously introduced urbanistic schemas,
              the molecule opens up the chance to bond to enhance both unity and secular-related living qualities.

              Similar to the trapped movement instantiated in the Gradual Assemblies, the project emerges throughout an ARPA-E solicitation
              that extends the Fulcrum into novel alloplastic territories by foregrounding operative design strategies. 
              The single-family house is devised in response to environmental concerns through 
              generous and affordable habitats that are frozen in a hilly site in Las Vegas. 
              As such, the shell transforms itself into a skin, a sentient layer of informed matter 
              that dynamically and interactively blurs the exterior and interior space.      
                
              
                
              Complementary to the modularity of benign plastic forks, these somehow extroverted dis/assemblable 
              paper cups (in)form themselves and the environment in response to several forces, including the inhabitant, the cliff holding it, and the sun. 
              The skin is a faceted network of articulated leaves that releases its frozen movement through affects.

                This project builds upon a workshop titled Topographies of Light, 
                conducted at MIT in collaboration with Aileen Iverson () and Andy Payne (McNeel). 
                While we first explored differential habitats through deductive reasoning, this subsequent exercise consisted of setting constraints 
                by which the form could find itself. As such, we designed a series of 
                hydrophilic elastic shells through the internal forces of the material and other 
                essential elements, such as gravity, sound, and light. 
                
                Each participant assembled a portal for linking a sensing skin (physical interface) with its digital counterpart,
                enabling a "sur le motif" multiplicity of possibilities beyond gestural instinctive approaches. 
                fuse roof and wall, surface and structure, openings and background, unlocking families of antimodernist spaces inhabited
                beyond projective experiences.
