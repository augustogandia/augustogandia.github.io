    <h2>Frameless Pivots (Carbon House, 2023)</h2>
    <p>This investigation delves into a set of elegant, high-performing hinges that allow for disassembly. Based on the Shadow of Ledoux project, the integral two-part hinges (private nest and public shell) are designed with these movements and the lightness of carbon components in mind. Therefore, the hinges are directly inserted into minimally invasive perforations on the wall panel, and all required features are integrated in the window, while maximizing daylight and guaranteeing air-tightness.
The hinges are material and waste optimized for fiber-reinforced 3D printing and ease of repair. The general system is also material and assembly optimized, dispensing with window frames and attached through recyclable mechanical fasteners. The hinges are corrosion-resistant and can eventually be redesigned as part of responsive systems. As they are collaboratively designed and produced with modularity in mind, they could be shared and locally printed to facilitate repair and adaptation.
