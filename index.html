  <h1>Immergent Manifolds: A Carbon Ontology for the Housing Crisis</h1>
  <p>
  *Intro to the housing problem
    
  Immergent (immanent + emergence) Manifolds are portals for connecting the inhabitant, site, and high-performing carbon materials across space and time. 
  It is a novel design methodology for exploring elegant, streamlined, high-performing composite habitats. 
    
  As in the Mont Blanc ascent, this series of interdisciplinary instances unveils the version of the story omitted by Balmat and the scientific elite, an attempt to erase one of the expedition's initiators.
  The proposal is a non-hierarchical, relational, and dynamic diagram that guides the materialization of such theoretical and practice-oriented endeavors.

                As part of this teaching and research project, a student from the Media Lab explores m(a)cro scale light artifacts. 
                
                They start as a series of generic plywood and plexiglass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Clouds</a>,
                and evolve into site and time-sensitive <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/light-sculpture/overview/" target="_blank">Light Sculptures</a>. 

                The design process starts by experiencing different sites while searching for interesting moments of light and history (e.g. the carpenter center of visual arts). 
                These are recorded through computer vision as image schematas of emerging light phenomena, 
                later materialized as inhabitable bays or islands of transparent stacked intensities.

              <p>Building upon the Fulcrum House (*add publication), this research project extends the exploration to dis/assamble composite habitats.

                Situated by a cliff in Upstate New York, the cantilevering habitat adapts through performative manifolds (subtracted cores and additively produced details for skin wrapping), 
                to the inhabitant's desires, the site, and local anomalies of the jointing system.

              This investigation explores a design method for composite details.   
              Through interdisciplinary work with a product designer, integral designs are developed beyond performance and optimization.
