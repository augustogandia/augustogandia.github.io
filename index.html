  <h1>Augusto Gandia - Beyond the Pole </h1>
  <p>
    If Scott and Amundsen offer two poles within the history of the frozen surface, a third, quieter figure was almost erased: Dr. Michel-Gabriel Paccard.
    He was a man whose vision, preparation, and quiet persistence brought him to the summit of Mont Blanc, only to have his achievement obscured by the opportunism, neglect, and anti-system beliefs of others.
    Paccard was neither a diplomat, a politician, nor a lawyer; he was an intuitive introvert in 18th-century Chamonix, deeply motivated by the scientific promise of high-altitude exploration. 
    He pursued the peak driven by curiosity, creativity, humility, fairness, and desire for knowledge, proposing an alternative path to the most explored directions.
    His companion, Jacques Balmat, brought instruments and barometers to measure air pressure, which undoubtedly supported the endeavor. 
    However, in the months that followed the ascent, Balmat’s narrative overtook Paccard’s by aligning with the scientific elite; he 
    crafted a version in which he was “the architect” of the mission, while Paccard, the originator of the expedition, was diminished by narrative control, and who knows what.

    My work, conducted as part of the Bauhaus Uni Weimar, ETH Zurich, MIT, and as independent researcher, concentrates on a relational, non-hierarchical, and dynamic diagram for the exploration of 
    archipelagically produced regenerative bespoke composite architecture. This pursuit aims at addressing critical societal issues —sustainability, equity, and resilience—while engaging scientific 
    (poetic phenomenology) and technological (design and manufacturing) questions across scales.

              This investigation explores the design of a set of elegant, lightweight carbon hinges as part of the prefabricated bespoke system of the Carbon House. As in the Shadow of Ledoux, the integral two-part design evokes a conversation of private and public spaces that emerge from the lightness of fiber-reinforced components, the movements of the machining process, and their disassembly. 
              The design relates to the site through minimally invasive subtracted perforations that hold them into the wall panel without additional frames and through channels for detail embedding (e.g. gaskets). As such, the integral design maximizes daylight, guarantees air-tightness, and allows for disassembly.

              This teaching and research project aims to digitally design and fabricate an ephemeral shading pergola for the Swiss Institute in Rome. It is conceptualized as part of an internal competition, planned to be produced as modules at the Robotic Fabrication Laboratory of ETH Zurich, and shipped and assembled at the stratified rooftop of the Institute. 
              The selected design digitally emerges as an all-timber choreography of the quintet's inward and outward forces: students, material, two gantry robots, and the site (building, sun, the neighborhood).
              Fabrication starts by robotically shaping, placing, and orienting a timber slat. A second robot performs a minimally invasive perforation, to be joined by leveraging human dexterity and the hygroscopic properties of wood when inserting, adjusting the humidity for interlocking through expansion, and cutting the dowels (using traditional Japanese saws). 
              This strategy allows designing for disassembly, future extension, and reuse through a material, waste, and onsite assembly-conscious approach
